# UFOs - Challenge Number Eleven 

## Overview of the Analysis

The overview of this analysis was to assist Dana, a data journalist with her article on McMinnville, Oregon home to many UFO sightings and gatherings of UFO and alien enthusiasts.  By using JavaScript, we were able to filter the large amount of data to support UFO sightings across the country and world.  We were able to then provide a presentable table that can be sorted by date, city and country by any given user input.  The end result of the analysis was to provide interested parties with specific evidence such as the shape and location of the sighting in connection with an article that is largely opinion based.
